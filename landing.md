### Welcome

Welcome to WanDevs, the community powering the growth of cross-blockchain technology. WanDevs is a community of blockchain developers who seek to educate, advocate, build, and grow cross-blockchain technology powered by Wanchain. The community is supported by the Wanchain Foundation in that the Foundation will provide ongoing support to developers, as well as the opportunity for financial support for excellent dApps or tools that emerge from the community.

### Getting Started

1.	Sign up for our Gitter Community <a href="https://gitter.im/wandevs/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="link" tabindex="0">here</a> or click the Open Chat button in the bottom-right of your screen, and introduce yourself to the team.
2.	Please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/EKfezdardvMldK0u2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="link" tabindex="0">this welcome form</a>.
3.	Contact [Oliver](mailto:oliver@wanchain.org) to collect your 100 WAN sign-up gift (requires verification of an active Github)
4.	Invite other blockchain developers in your network to join WanDevs (50 WAN referral gift for up to 10 referrals). Referral gift will be given when a new developer joins the Gitter, completes the welcome form, lists you in the “referred by” box, and has been confirmed to have an active Github account.

### Start Building
There are many opportunities to contribute to the WanDevs community. The projects below are examples of some of the highest priority needs. Bounties will vary on a case-by-case basis, so please reach out to us to discuss in advance of starting a project.

- Quick Tools

  Quick tools such as a Wanchain address validator, or a Wanchain address converter to convert an Ethereum address to Wanchain address. Quick tools ported from Ethereum to Wanchain are also welcome.  The tools can be provided as standalone applications or as an online service. For example, WanDevs has already ported MyEtherWallet and MetaMask to become Wanchain-compatible.
- dApps using on iWan and WanX
  
  With iWan and WanX providing connectivity to Wanchain’s blockchain, developers can easily build dApps using these API and SDKs.  Developers are free to build applications for decentralized finance and other areas of interest or expertise.

- Open-Ended Projects Proposals

  If you have a cool idea and want to be funded, you can submit a proposal to Wanchain. Wanchain’s team will evaluate the proposal and provide possible feedback and support.  The topics that we are particular interested are in cross-blockchain use cases and decentralized financial applications.

- Offline Wallet

  Build a wallet that can be used to create and sign transactions on an offline machine, then copy the signed raw data to an online machine to send out the transaction to the blockchain. This application will benefit users who do not have a hardware wallet and would like to ensure that their transactions and private keys are secure and not tampered by malware and viruses.
- iWan Clients

  iWan is an infrastructure that provides an API and SDK for developers building applications without the need to run blockchain nodes. Currently a client SDK based on nodejs has been developed. There is a need to develop other SDK clients in programming languages such as java, python, go, C++ etc.
