## Introduction to dApp development

Since Wanchain runs on the EVM as well its smart to familiarize yourself with the EVM first. There are some pretty good reads on EVM already you could start with:
- https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial

Once you are familiar with the EVM, you should read the [Using WanMask](/create-application/using-wanmask) page to get an idea of how you can create a dApp that interacts with WanMask. If you want to run blockchain interactions from your backend, you should read the information on smartcontracts, privacy transactions and crosschain as well.
