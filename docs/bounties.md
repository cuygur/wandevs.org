## Bounty Types: Close Ended & Open Ended Bounties
*The bounty program consists of two types of bounties:*

**Close ended:** These bounties are specific projects which the WanDevs team has defined detailed specifications for. In order to be eligible for these bounties, a developer must simply choose the bounty they are applying for, and apply through the "Apply Now" button above. Through the application process you will be asked to provide information demonstrating you posses the skills and resources needed to complete the bounty. Please wait until the WanDevs has approved your application to begin building, as not all applications will be accepted, and each close ended bounty will have only one successful applicant (however if you have an idea for how to improve a close ended bounty project, you are free to propose it as an open ended bounty through the "Apply Now" form above). See the list of close ended bounties below. The list will be updated regularly to display claimed and completed bounties. Bounty updates will be posted in the official WanDevs Gitter channel.

**Open ended:** These bounties are unique projects proposed by WanDevs community members. We specify several general areas we are interested in, but developers are free to pitch any type of project they are interested in building. The application process for open ended bounties requires the applicant to demonstrate they have the skills and resources neeeded to complete the bounty. Please wait until the WanDevs team has approved your bounty proposal to begin working on your project, as not all bounty applications will be approved. Multiple developers may be approved for open ended bounties even within the same category of project, so feel free propose any project you are interested in (you are also more than welcome to propose an improvement to an already existing open source Wanchain project). The WanDevs team may ask you to modify your proposal in order to be eligable for the bounty. Bounties will be paid upon completion of all the project's features as defined in your proposal. See suggested projects below, and apply through the "Apply Now" button above to submit your proposal. 

# Current Close Ended Bounties

### 1. Escrow Smart Contract with Front End Interface -- 5000 WAN? 

**Basic Description:**  

Allows two users to trade a specified amount of one WRC20 token for another through an escrow smart contract. For example, Person A has 30 ETH and Person B has 1 BTC, and they would both like to exchange at the rate of 30 ETH to 1 BTC. In order to make the transaction, both parties must send a transaction to the smart contract specifying several parameters: 
  
* Which token is being traded for which other token 
* The quantity of each token to be traded 
* The address which they intend to trade with 

Once the smart contract receives matching parameters from both parties, it will automatically execute the trade. If any of the parameters do not match, then the trade will be canceled. 

**Requirements List:**

* Core dApp logic coded as a smart contract 
* Attractive and user friendly front end interface 
* Hosting for the front end interface – centralized or IPFS? 
* Security audit (Can Wanchain team do this?)

### 2. Simple rock, paper, scissors or card game -- 2500 WAN?

**Basic Description:**  

Allows users to compete against each other in an on chain version of rock paper scissors or some version of a card game. Both users lock up a certain amount in a smart contract an send their game move to the contract in an encrypted way so that neither player can gain an advantage by knowing the other player’s choice in advance. After receiving both player choices and locked tokens, the smart contract decrypts player’s choices and decides on the winner and sends both player’s staked tokens to the winner. 
  
**Requirements List:**  

* Core dApp logic coded as a smart contract 
* Users game choices must be put on chain in an encrypted way so neither player can gain an advantage by learning the other player’s choice first
* Attractive front end interface 
* Hosting for the front end interface – centralized or IPFS? 
* Security audit 


### 3. Wanchain based DEX -- 50,000+ WAN? 

**Basic Description:**

**Requirements List:**

* Core dApp logic coded as a smart contract 
* Continually supporting the operation of the platform 
* Attractive front end interface 
* Hosting for the front end interface – centralized or IPFS? 
* Security audit
