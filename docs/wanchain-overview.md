## Context

Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual named Satoshi Nakamoto. In his whitepaper Satoshi outlined his vision for "A peer to peer electronic cash system". As time went by, Bitcoin started getting traction and was increasingly used in commerce. 
Ethereum was launched in 2015 with the intent of creating a network for "programmable money" which could one day become the backbone of a new decentralized financial system.

Time went by, and many new blockchains started to appear each one for a different use case  privacy, scalability, governance... These protocols all had a different vision, roadmap and community. 
It became obvious that the future of this industry would depend on many heterogenous blockchains which would each have its own set of rules and governance processes.

These blockchains would each be in their own bubble, siloed and closed to the outside. 
Much like the days of the intranet, when we had private networks which could not communicate between one and another. The question now arose, how do we go from  a network of intranets to the internet? 

How do we transition from an  ecosystem of siloed blockchains to the internet of blockchains? 
Wanchain is a project that aims to answer this question. It  started in 2016 as an effort to build an infrastructure which could support the transfer of value between different blockchains. 

## Vision 

The rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum was the first step toward creating a new global financial system. Where people are able to transact, enter into agreements and financial settlements in a peer to peer manner without requiring a third party to instigate trust in the process. 
The current industry however, is far from being fully decentralized. Many assets are entrusted to centralized institutions such as exchanges. This stems from the fact that heterogenous chains cannot communicate with one and another, so whenever users needs to exchange between different assets they have to rely on exchanges to make the transaction.

This current situation has become a threat for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a monopoly has been formed by those exchanges. Large sums of funds are trusted to these entities which could at any moment get hacked,  compromised by malevolent actors etc...
Any monopoly can be dangerous for the future of an industry, for such a young space it could alter innovation and delay the coming of a global decentralized financial system.

For this very reason, Wanchain believes the problem of interoperability needs to be solved in order for the cryptocurrency industry to achieve its true potential. 
Our vision is to build out a blockchain which allows for decentralized cross chain transfer of value between heterogenous chains. Wanchain would be the platform which to host financial dApps that need to access different kind of assets
