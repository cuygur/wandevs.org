## Solidity Experience

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the EVM. Solidity is compiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM. With Solidity, developers are able to write applications that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts.

Solidity shares many similariliraties with Javascript and is considered an easy and quick language to grasp. Currently most decentralized applications that have been deployed utilize Solidity and we expect this trend to continue. Below we provide a list of third party resources which can help in your quest to learn this language

- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) - Interactive code school that teaches you to write smart contracts through building your own crypto-collectables game.
- [EthereumDev.io](https://ethereumdev.io) - Complete tutorial from starting to writing complex smart contracts and DApps.

## Solidity Environment Setup

You can use any text editor that, preferably, supports Solidity syntax highlighting. Some of the popular editors are Virtual Studio Code Text and Atom. You can also use an IDE which provides a more complete developer experience. Below we compiled a list of suggestiin to get you set up.

- [Cryptofex](https://cryptofex.io/download/) - Standalone IDE and compiler.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Online realtime compiler and runtime.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century
- [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Free. Open source. Runs everywhere.
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor — and more.
